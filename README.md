# Raytracer

A simple raytracer, which can read and display different Blender files (.obj or .gltf - see for example data folder) Attention: This is not an optimized raytracer.

The raytracer was implemented as part of the lecture "Advanced Computer Graphics" (FCG) of the master's degree "Informatik" at Hochschule Kaiserslautern - University of Applied Sciences, Campus Zweibrücken.
